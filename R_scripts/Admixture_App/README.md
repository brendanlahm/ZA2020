# To run the Admixture App:

1) Open Admixture_App.Rproj & Admixture_App.R

2) Check that the folder containing the App is your current working directory in R

3) Run the following command in your R console:
```r
renv::restore()
```
This command restores the App's environment. However, you may still be prompted to install any packages that were missed (e.g. reshape2)

4) Click Run App

## app.R was used for creating the Docker image
